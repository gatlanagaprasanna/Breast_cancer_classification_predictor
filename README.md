# Breast Cancer Classification Predictor

A simple and user-friendly web app built with **Streamlit** to predict whether a breast tumor is **Malignant** or **Benign** based on input medical features. The model is trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using machine learning techniques.

---

## Features

- Clean web interface built with **Streamlit**
- Uses a trained **scikit-learn** model
- Real-time predictions
- Easy to use for demonstration and educational purposes

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- pickle (for saving the model)

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html)
- **Features:** 30 numerical features describing characteristics of the cell nuclei in breast mass
- **Target:** Diagnosis (`0` = malignant, `1` = benign)

---

## Features Used

Here are a few of the 30 features used in prediction:

- Mean radius  
- Mean texture  
- Mean perimeter  
- Mean area  
- Mean smoothness  
*(and more...)*
